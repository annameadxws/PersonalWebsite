<p>Special effects makeup artists will spend much of their time using cosmetics and appliances to create the appearance of bruises, cuts, blood, old age, deformities, mutations, and more. This specialist artist is charged with creating monsters using makeup and prosthetics, often made of latex, silicone, or rubber. Special effects makeup artists are different from regular makeup artists: Instead of beautifying actors and actresses, they often spend their time doing the exact opposite</p>
